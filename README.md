This is an android app to restart an O2 router.

My router seems to be on the way out, and sometimes some devices have no internet access, even though they can access the router fine.

A reboot usually fixes the issue, so due to laziness, I wrote this app to restart the router over wifi.
It was written in a few hours one evening so it's not polished at all!

It connects to the router via telnet, logs in as SuperUser using the router's serial and issues the reboot command.

If you have a Thompson O2 router, then this app may work for you. If not then it's extremely unlikely that it will work!
